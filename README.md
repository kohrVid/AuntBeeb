This is a HTML5/CSS-only replica of the BBC News website from March 2015 (created right before the site's main layout was last changed). It's based on the webpage demonstrated in *The Complete Web Developer Course - Build 14 Websites* series published by Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course).

I haven't made any major changes to the page since March though I am not quite happy with the stylesheet. The webpage contains a search bar that links to the BBC website.
